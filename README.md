# Secure Access & Visitor Approval Backend

A **backend-driven visitor management solution** designed for institutions and organizations to manage secure authentication, role-based permissions, real-time visitor approvals, and email notifications efficiently.

---

## üíº About the Project

This backend service facilitates secure and scalable visitor management by enabling staff and wardens to create and approve visitor requests in real-time. It incorporates strong security practices, email notifications, and performance optimizations to ensure robustness and responsiveness.

---

## üöÄ Core Features

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Staff (guards) can create visitor requests.
  - Wardens can approve or reject visitor requests.

- **Security-First Approach**
  - JWT authentication with refresh tokens for secure sessions.
  - Rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks.
  - Safeguards against SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

- **Real-Time Updates**
  - Instant visitor approval/rejection notifications using Socket.IO.

- **Email Notifications**
  - Automatic email alerts for visitor approvals/rejections using **Nodemailer**.

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Redis caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times.

- **REST API Architecture**
  - Modular, scalable endpoints designed for easy integration and maintenance.
